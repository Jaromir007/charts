# Charts - Hackclub neighbourhood app

My app is for people who write or play any type of music. It allows you to upload the lyrics with chords in ChordsPro format and get rendered PDF, make notes and edits edits inside, and most importantly, have your own author page where you can upload your songs. If I have any spare time, I would also like to implement some AI, that could turn the PDF back into ChordsPro.

Stack: Django, HTML, CSS, JS.
