## Hackclub neighbourhood app

My app is for people who write or play any type of music. It allows you to upload the lyrics with chords in ChordsPro format and get rendered PDF, make notes, and edits inside of the app and most importantly, have your own author page where you can upload your songs. If I have any spare time, I would also like to implement some AI, that could turn the PDF back into ChordsPro.

The stack is: Django, HTML, CSS, JS, but I am planning to learn SASS and possibly TS, to make it more robust end efficient. I use Figma for high fidelity design and for wireframes paper and pencil. Currenty I am on Windows, because it was easier for me to set up hackatame, but my main operating system is Fedora linux.
